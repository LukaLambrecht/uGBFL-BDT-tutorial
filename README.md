## uGBFL BDT tutorial

This is a small tutorial on the correlation between a classifier output score and another variable (e.g. mass): why it is a problem and how to avoid it.
In particular, we show as example a BDT with uniform gradient boosting with flatness loss (uGBFL), introduced [here](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-0221/10/03/T03002).
See the tutorial notebook for more details.
